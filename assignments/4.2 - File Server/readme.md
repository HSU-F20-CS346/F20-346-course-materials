# CS 346 Assignment #4.2 - File Server
In this assignment, you will begin contributing to your team's file transfer program.  

# Project Requirements
Because there are multiple paths to success, there are no hard and fast requirements.  Instead, I present the following outlines:

## Definitely an A
1. To definitely get an A, you must work on and complete a major feature.  Major features are those that are technically complex and/or lengthy. Your work must include giving Issue updates updates and the creation of new and the updating of existing project documentation.  Upon completing the major feature, you submit a pull request into the main branch of your project.  Note that the PR does not have to be accepted by the group (and probably shouldn't unless it's undergone code review).  Individuals or teams of up to 2 can work together in order to complete a major feature.  

## Probably an A
To probably get an A...

2. You must work on, but not necessarily complete a major issue in the manner described in item 1 (issue tracking, project documentation, PRs if applicable).
3. You must work on and complete several minor issues in the manner described in item 1.  Minor issues are not as technically complex and/or lengthy.
4. You are a secondary contributor (i.e. someone that isn't you did more/most of the work on the feature) on several major projects.

## Definitely a B
5. You work on, but don't complete several minor issues in the manner described in item 1.

## Definitely a C
6. You are a secondary contributor on several minor projects.

## D and F
7. You did nothing or very little.  You weren't very communicative with your group.

## Special Considerations
In addition to programming activity, special considerations (i.e. getting a higher grade) will be given to students who are proactive in their groups.  Examples of evidence include, but are not limited to:

1. Updating documentation
2. Overall project management
3. Helping team mates with project issues (e.g. git problems, stuck on coding issue, etc.)
4. Performing code reviews on pull requests
5. (other ideas to be added after we discuss this in class)

# Deliverables
I will inspect your team's repository for evidence of your contributions.  To make this easier, you are required to submit a report on Canvas that informs me of the grade that you think you deserve based on the criteria set forth in this document.  Be sure to include examples and links to help my grading go easier.  Lastly, include a general reflection of your progress.  Here's an example:

```
Based on the criteria of homework 4.2, I deserve an A for the following reasons:
1. I created 5 new widget classes (link: github.com/xyz).  These widgets will be used to interface with sprockets that are being developed by another student.
2. I created a pull request to merge my changes into the main branch (link: github.com/link/to/pr)
3. I did a code review on pull request by Billy Student (link: github.com/link/to/other/pr)
4. I updated our repository's documentation to include new information on the sprockets (link: github.com/link/to/documentation)

Reflection:
Boy, widgets really turned out to be a lot more difficult than I imagined.  I thought I would need a flux capacitor in order to implement the required baryon sweep but it turns out that I actually needed a type L pahse discriminating amplifier.  This rabbit hole took several hours and left me feeling rather depressed....(more content)
