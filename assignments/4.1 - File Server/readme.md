# CS 346 Assignment #4.1 - File Server
In this assignment, you will contribute a shared github repository for your team's file transfer program.  A walkthrough of what is expected will be done in class and the video video recording will be posted on Canvas.

# Getting Started
I will create the repositories for each team and will add you as a contributor.  Be sure to accept the invite to the repository (look in your email).

# Project Requirements
In order to receive full credit, your program must meet the following requirements.

## Project board & Issues set up
You should have a fully fleshed out project board with associated issues created.  Each issue should be appropriately scoped and should have to one or more individuals assigned to them.  Issues should be written in such a way that someone external to your team would understand the problem and be able to contribute a pull request. 

## Documentation
Your project should have all appropriate documentation such that someone outside of your team should be able to understand and implement your file transfer protocol.  

## Unit tests
Your project should have a unit testing project as well as unit tests for all major code segments to be written.  

# Tips on writing issues
Good issues should be atomic, have a good title, and describe WHO, WHAT, and WHY. 
* **__Atomic__**: Issue focuses on exactly one concern. 
* **__Title__**: Issue title is short and descriptive.
* **__WHO__**: Issue identifies who is affected by the change. 
* **__WHAT__**: Issue describes what is being changed.  
* **__WHY__**: Issue provides a rationale for the code change. 

An easy way to hit all of this is to create issues whose title is in the following format:

```As a <User Type>, I can <Perform Action> so that <Reason why User Type would want to perform action>```

Example:

```As a IT administrator, I can scan a given port on a server so that I can tell whether or not a given service is running on that server.```

Additionally, acceptance criteria (how you know when the issue is done) should be provided in the issue's description. 
Acceptance criterial are ideally listed as checkboxes using brackets in markdown [].  Note that it is acceptable to create acceptance criteria as you
go alone.  Acceptance criteria themselves should be atomic. E.g. "Allow user to specify either TCP or UDP" is a good
acceptance criteria whereas "Complete basic project requirements" is not.  

Here's an example checklist in markdown

- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

Note that all checkboxes should be checked before closing an issue.

# Deliverables
In addition to the github repository and buddy report, submit a brief report on Canvas that indicates your contributions to getting the repository set up correctly.  Also, list the parts of the project that you have been assigned.  It is okay to plan to work with others.

# Grading
* Completing the basic requirements, github workflow, design diary, and buddy report will result in full credit
* Completing one or more bonuses will result in extra credit if and only if all requirements 
have been implemented.  

# Due Date
The official deadline is Friday, October 16, 2020 by midnight.  Submit your written deliverables on Canvas.
