## Required Software
* Programs will be written in C#.  I recommend [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) if you're on OSX or Windows.  [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) works well for Linux.  Our Vlab machines come pre-configured with Visual Studio and C#.
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).  Be sure to download both the "platform package" and "Extension Pack."
* [Licecap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) or some orther screen recording software.  **NOTE** I've included a standalone EXE for Windows users in the Utils directory of this repository. 

## Github Usage
All projects will be hosted in Github using this organization (HSU-F20-CS346).  You can get enrolled in this organization by taking the following steps:

1. If you don't already have a GitHub account, sign up for one at github.com.  It's free.
2. Add your HSU email to your GitHub account.  GitHub accounts can have multiple email addresses, so if you already created your GitHub account with some other email, it's fine.  The HSU email doesn't even have to be the "primary" email; it just has to be one of the emails associated with your GitHub account.  You do this on the Settings page for your GitHub account.
3. Visit the web app: https://ucsb-cs-github-linker.herokuapp.com  and login with your GitHub account.
4. On that home page of that web app, you should see our course listed: HSU-F20-CS346.  Click the link to joing the course.  That generates an "invitation" to the HSU-F20-CS243 organization.  Click to accept the invitation.
5. You should then be able to navigate to https://github.com/HSU-F20-CS346 and see that you are a part of the organization.

If you have any difficulty, use the chat-cs346 channel on the CS Club Discord server.

## Github Software
If you are on Windows, you will need to download [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  When installing Git for Windows, accepting the default options should be fine.  OSX and Linux are a bit different, but you can still find instructions on how to set this up [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  

Git is a command-line utility so you're going to have to download a GUI wrapper if you want graphical integration.  I use [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/) because I like it's Windows Shell integration.  However, it does have a bit of a learning curve.  [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is quite popular with beginners is a good choice.  I've heard good things aobut [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).  It's paid software, but it does have a free student licnese.
